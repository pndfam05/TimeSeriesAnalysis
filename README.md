# TimeSeriesAnalysis
Visualizing time series data and graphing for better understanding of best contiguous hours to initiate directed enforcement for maximum effectiveness.

This project is purposed for law enforcement agencies with a crime prevention mission. It targets crimes where the exact day and time of occurrence cannot be known. For instance, your car is stolen sometime between 1 am and 8 am, or your home is burgled between 10 pm Friday and 1 pm Sunday. If you have limited human resources that you can dedicate to targeted patrols, what is the optimal timeframe?

The code can likely be adapted to other purposes. If you do, please share changes, how you implemented them and the problem you focused on.
